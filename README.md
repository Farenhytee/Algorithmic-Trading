# Algorithmic Trading System Documentation

## Overview
This algorithmic trading system is designed to automate trading decisions in the Indian stock market (NSE) using a combination of technical analysis, statistical methods, and multi-timeframe analysis. The system leverages the Upstox API to fetch real-time and historical market data, perform analysis, and generate trading signals.

## System Architecture

### 1. Data Collection and Authentication
The system uses the Upstox API for market data access, implementing a secure OAuth2 authentication flow:
- Secure storage of API credentials in a dedicated Secrets directory
- Token-based authentication with automatic refresh
- Real-time and historical data fetching capabilities
- Support for both intraday and end-of-day data
