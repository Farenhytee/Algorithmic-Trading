## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. **Setup Authentication**

You'll need an Upstox Account to get their API. Follow the steps here:
https://upstox.com/trading-api/

Once you receive your Client ID, API Key, and API Secret, you'll need to authorize your credentials using the code in Cell 1. After you authorise, you'll receive a 6 letter code on the redirect URL. Use that in Cell 2 to get the access token.

This part has to be done manually due to regulations.

Do not hardcode any of your credentials. Make a .env file or a separate .py file to store all the credentials (except the auth and access tokens, because they have an expiration time and have to be acquired again), and use f strings and imports to get them. 

```python
# In Cell 1 and 2: Update your Upstox API credentials
params = {
    "code": "YOUR_AUTH_CODE",  # Get from Upstox OAuth flow
    "client_id": f"{UPSTOX_API_KEY}",
    "client_secret": f"{UPSTOX_API_SECRET}",
    # ... other params
}
```

After you get the access token, the algorithm is ready.

### 2. **Configure Strategy**
```python
# In Cell 3: Customize your trading parameters
TIMEFRAME_1 = 1    # Short-term analysis (days)
TIMEFRAME_2 = 7    # Medium-term analysis (days)
TIMEFRAME_3 = 14   # Long-term analysis (days)

WEIGHT_1 = 0.6     # Weight for short-term performance
WEIGHT_2 = 0.3     # Weight for medium-term performance
WEIGHT_3 = 0.1     # Weight for long-term performance

REBALANCE_FREQUENCY = 7  # Rebalancing interval (days)
```

### 3. **Run Backtest**

## Before running, create a folder named "BacktestLogs". The backtesting logs, including the csv files and a detailed txt file will be saved there. If you wish to change the directory, please also make the changes in the update_port method inside the backtest_v3 class, cell 5.

```python
# Execute the backtest
backtest_time = int(input("Enter backtest duration (Years, maximum 10): "))
test = backtest_v3(backtest_time)
test.old_graph() # Gets the initial portfolio chart
test.update_port()  # Run the backtest, this will take time
test.new_graph() #Gets the final portfolio graph
```

### 4. **View Results**
```python
# Display results
print(test.calculate_CAGR())
test.combined_growth_chart()  # View performance charts
```

## üéØ Strategy Details

### üìà **Performance Analysis Algorithm**

The system analyzes stock performance using a sophisticated multi-timeframe approach:

#### **1. Data Collection**
- Fetches daily historical data for each stock
- Covers sufficient period to analyze all configured timeframes
- Uses Upstox V3 API for reliable data access

#### **2. Performance Calculation**
For each stock and timeframe:
```python
performance = (current_price - past_price) * 100 / past_price
```

#### **3. Weighted Scoring**
```python
final_score = (timeframe1_performance * WEIGHT_1 + 
               timeframe2_performance * WEIGHT_2 + 
               timeframe3_performance * WEIGHT_3)
```

#### **4. Signal Generation**
- **Buy Signal**: Score ‚â• 2.0
- **Hold Signal**: Score between 0 and 2.0
- **Sell Signal**: Score < 0

### üèÜ **Stock Selection Process**

1. **Universe**: 24 carefully selected Indian stocks across sectors. You can modify to include any stocks, no limits. Analysis and backtest times will increase accordingly.
2. **Ranking**: Stocks ranked by weighted performance score
3. **Selection**: Top 10 performers selected for portfolio
4. **Weighting**: Equal allocation across selected stocks

### üîÑ **Portfolio Rebalancing Logic**

The system uses intelligent rebalancing to minimize unnecessary transactions:

#### **Smart Rebalancing Process**:
1. **Identify Changes**: Compare current top 10 with existing portfolio
2. **Categorize Stocks**:
   - **Keep**: Stocks remaining in top 10
   - **Drop**: Stocks falling out of top 10
   - **Add**: New stocks entering top 10
3. **Execute Transactions**:
   - **Sell**: Only stocks being dropped
   - **Buy**: Only new stocks being added
   - **Hold**: Existing stocks staying in top 10

   - Visit URL, login, and copy the authorization code
   - Paste code in Cell 1 and run to get access token

### üîÑ **Using Other APIs**

To use a different API provider, modify these components:

#### **1. Authentication (Cells 1-2)**:
Replace Upstox OAuth with your API's authentication method

#### **2. Data Fetching Function**:
In `portfolio_custom_date_m1_v3()`, update:
```python
# Change this URL format:
url2 = f'https://api.upstox.com/v3/historical-candle/{key}/days/1/{to_date}/{from_date}'

# To your API's endpoint format, example:
url2 = f'https://your-api.com/historical/{symbol}?from={from_date}&to={to_date}'
```

#### **3. Response Structure**:
Update data parsing based on your API's response format:
```python
# Upstox format: response2["data"]["candles"]
# Your API format: response2["your_data_key"]
```

#### **4. Stock Symbols**:
Update the `keys` dictionary with your API's symbol format:
```python
keys = {"YOUR_SYMBOL_FORMAT": "STOCK_NAME", ...}
```
